# StoryScraper

This Python-based tool is designed to scrape reading lists from https://www.wattpad.com, with the goal of collecting story links for use in FanFicFare. It has undergone two significant revisions thus far, and a third revision is currently underway, which will feature a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).
